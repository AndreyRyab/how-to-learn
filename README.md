#How to learn 
 
Here's my very first web-page, created while studying at Yandex.Praktikum. There’re 11 sections, including: 
 
* hero-page with animated shape 
* list of cards with pics, headings and descriptions (similar to advantages section)
* iframes with video-players
* quote with formatted texts
* numbered list
* partnership page
* tree-columns footer

The project is made on html&css. I’m planning to add some parallax effects and animations using js.
